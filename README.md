# Repository for final project

This project demonstrates the creation of a web-based application, which processes user input and deciphers the associated emotion expressed. It uses embeddable Watson AI libraries. 
This is the final project for IBM's Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask.

I did not create any of the files contained within the static directory or the templates directory.
I created all files contained within the EmotionDetection package, the server.py file, as well as the test_emotion_detection.py file.
